# Assignment Enterprise Linux: High Availability

- Student: NAME
- Repository: <https://github.com/HoGentTIN/elnx-ha-USER.git>

The goal of this assignment is to set up a proof-of-concept for the infrastructure of a large website in a virtualized environment using the [Ansible](https://ansible.com/) Ansible configuration management system. When you're finished, you should be able to recreate the entire infrastructure *from scratch* using a minimum of manual interventions, ideally a single command (`vagrant up`).

This repository contains the [assignments](doc/), and some scaffolding code to get you started.

The scaffolding code is based on [ansible-skeleton](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-skeleton), a framework for quickly setting up an Ansible development and testing environment powered by [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).
